You will be writing a program that ouputs the amount of time that has
passed since
[Epoch.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_%28reference_date%29#Computing)

There are other data types besides strings, integers, and doubles. For
example, some of C++'s date manipulation functions use the data type
`time\_t`.

Write a program that prints out the time that has passed since the Epoch
in 1) seconds, 2) hours, and 3) years (ignoring leap years, so each year
is 365 days) each on a separate line. Integer division is acceptable.

HINT: googling "c++ time since epoch" might be useful in finding
functions to help you.

Sample output:

    Seconds: 86400
    Hours: 24
    Years: 0
